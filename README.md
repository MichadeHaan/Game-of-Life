# Game-of-Life

## Introduction

Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. The game is played on a two-dimensional grid of cells, each of which can be alive or dead. The state of the grid evolves in discrete steps according to a set of simple rules.

## Rules

1. **Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies** (underpopulation).
2. **Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation** (survival).
3. **Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies** (overpopulation).
4. **Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell** (reproduction).
